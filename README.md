## How good a developer do I consider myself to be?
I consider myself a sincere person, and I feel that I still have a lot to learn, so I feel that I can be a better developer than I really am, but every day I learn more and more, and that is what makes me continue in this world of programming, I may not be the best but I have the goal of being the best, and I will fulfill it!

♥ Have a good day!
